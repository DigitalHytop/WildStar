Created to assist with those pesky uncompletable quest as you work your way through Nexus.

Use the ! button to show a list of accepted quests in the chat window, complete with ID numbers. Enter the ID number shown for whatever quest won't complete and press the check mark button to auto achieve the stubborn quest. Keep in mind, not all quests can be completed in this fashion. Quests requiring you to speak to an non-spawned NPC or an NPC in an unreachable location are among the types that this addon will not work for and will need to be abandoned from the Quest Log.

Default load will be on left side of screen, above the default chat window location. Addon can be positioned where you'd like by CTRL-Left mouse click on outer edges and drag to where you wish it to be.

Typing /nfqh will reset position back to default location and reloadUI.

Install the addon by copying the zip file to %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\NCSOFT\WildStar\addons and extract the enclosed folder.
