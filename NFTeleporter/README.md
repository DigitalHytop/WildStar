Created to assist with traversing Nexus while our Taxis are on strike.

Upon opening the pop-out panel by clicking on the NFT button, you'll be given the choice of Dominion or Exile faction destinations.  A green pusling button will indicate which has been chosen.  The dropdown list of places to teleport to will correspond to the Faction choice chosen.  Click on the location you wish to visit and press the green button to process the teleport.

Default load will be on left side of screen, above the default chat window location. Addon can be positioned where you'd like by CTRL-Left mouse click on outer edges and drag to where you wish it to be.

Typing /nft will reset position back to default location and reloadUI.

Install the addon by copying the zip file to %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\NCSOFT\WildStar\addons and extract the enclosed folder.
