A simple addon that provides a small, repositionable button to reload the client UI.

Default load will be on left side of screen, above the default chat window location. Addon can be positioned where you'd like by CTRL-Left mouse click and drag to where you wish it to be.

Typing /nfrui will reset position back to default location and reloadUI.

Install the addon by copying the zip file to %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\NCSOFT\WildStar\addons and extract the enclosed folder.
